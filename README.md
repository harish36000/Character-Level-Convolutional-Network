# Character-level-Convolutional-Networks-for-Text-Classification

- Implemented a Text Classifier based on Character-level
Convolutional Networks
- Performed preprocessing like removing hashtags, user ID etc.
- Implemented the model using TensorFlow and trained using Twitter
Tweets Dataset
- Compared the model accuracy against traditional method - TFIDF
with Multinomial Logistic Regression
